Being a nine-decade old institution, the infrastructure is a mix of the old and the new. There are several common conference halls across the campus and in addition several departments have their own well equipped seminar halls. University has been constantly upgrading the infrastructure to keep pace with increasing demand and additional requirements with financial assistance from UGC, ICAR, DST-FIST, Ministry of Environment, and DBT. The research and computer labs are equipped with state-of-the art equipment and technology comparable with any top Universities in the country. The University has invested substantially over the last few years to improve the classroom and laboratory infrastructure, books and journals, and online resources for teaching, learning, and research. Recent additions to infrastructure include electronic multi media centre, an Emergency Medicine Block, a twenty-four-hour pharmacy adjacent to the hospital, a rapid access Cardiac Wing, hostel for international students, the Digital Information Centre, and four new canteens. The Central Instrumentation Laboratory has facilities for advanced research work in the natural sciences. The General Library provides access to JSTOR for the social sciences and Science Direct for the physical and natural sciences. The Physical Education department with the gymnasium, impressive courts and tracks provides avenues for sports and games
